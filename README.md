## Requirements
#### Build the Similar Doctors
A simple web application which allows you to browse a list of doctors. When a doctor is
selected, display their details, along with a list of similar doctors, in a prioritized order. Similar is defined as having the same location and specialty as the current doctor. The Similar Doctors are then sorted alphabetically by name.
The published app can be found at https://similar-doctors-jf.herokuapp.com/
